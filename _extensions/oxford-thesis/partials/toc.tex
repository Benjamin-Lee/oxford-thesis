%%%%% LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS
% This example includes a list of abbreviations.  Look at text/abbreviations.tex to see how that file is
% formatted.  The template can handle any kind of list though, so this might be a good place for a
% glossary, etc.
% \include{text/abbreviations}

% The Roman pages, like the Roman Empire, must come to its inevitable close.
